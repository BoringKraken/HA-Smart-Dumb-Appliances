## Known Issues

### High Priority
1. **Entity Naming**: Entity names don't always update correctly when device is renamed after initial creation.
   - Status: âœ… Fixed in latest update
   - Fix: Implemented device registry update and entity name synchronization

2. **Entity Removal**: Entities sometimes remain in the registry after integration is removed.
   - Status: âœ… Fixed in latest update 
   - Fix: Added two-phase entity removal and improved cleanup process

3. **Listener Cleanup**: Errors during listener removal can cause warnings in logs.
   - Status: âœ… Fixed in latest update
   - Fix: Added proper error handling and better callback management

### Medium Priority
1. **Startup Delay**: Initial startup has a 10-second delay which can be improved.
   - Status: ðŸ”„ Partially addressed
   - Plan: Optimize delay based on dependency availability

2. **Update Frequency**: Current 1-second update interval may cause higher resource usage.
   - Status: ðŸ”„ Being monitored
   - Plan: Implement adaptive update intervals based on appliance state

3. **Error Visibility**: Some errors are logged but not visible to users in the UI.
   - Status: â¬œ Not yet addressed
   - Plan: Add notification system for critical errors

### Low Priority
1. **Configuration Options**: Limited customization options for advanced users.
   - Status: â¬œ Not yet addressed
   - Plan: Add advanced configuration options in future update

2. **Documentation**: Documentation needs to be updated with recent changes.
   - Status: â¬œ Not yet addressed
   - Plan: Update documentation in next cycle

3. **Logging Verbosity**: Debug logging may be too verbose in some scenarios.
   - Status: â¬œ Not yet addressed
   - Plan: Review and optimize logging levels
